  <p style="font-size:35px;">In today’s digital world, most of us spend long hours staring at screens.<br> This causes eye strain, dryness, and discomfort.  
    To protect your eyes, you must give them regular breaks. One of the best methods is following the <strong>20-20-20 rule</strong>.</p>
 
    <p style="font-size:30px;">The 20-20-20 rule means: Every 20 minutes, stop looking at your screen and focus on something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.  
     This helps to relax the eye muscles, reduce strain, and prevent long-term vision problems.</p>
   
     <p style="font-size:30px;">
        Along with this, try to blink often to keep your eyes moist. Avoid using your phone just before sleep and adjust your screen brightness to a comfortable level.  
        Taking short walks and closing your eyes for a minute can also help refresh your vision.</p>
